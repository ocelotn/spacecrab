<p>You leap out from behind the gear rack, heedless of your own safety.</p>  

<p>&quot;Divine Brachyura,&quot; you cry, startling your leader.  She turns to glare at you, claws clacking in outrage.  You gulp and continue, hoping she lets you have your say before she kills you.  &quot;Divine Brachyura, I have a plan!  THE DEATHSTARFISH!&quot;  You pause.  Divine Brachyura looks unimpressed, which startles you, but you rush to explain your idea.  &quot;What if we go, get its attention, and lead it here.  Surely, after waking from its hibernation, it will be hungry, won&#39;t it?  We can act as bait and lead it right here to Verru.  Once their base is destroyed, the craâ€”...carcinologists will scatter and retreat!&quot;</p>

<p>You stare at Divine Brachyura hopefully, waiting for her decision.  She&#39;s got to agree to do it, she&#39;s just got to!  If she doesn&#39;t, your people are doomed!  She&#39;s clacking her claws, she&#39;s glaring at you, but...</p>

<p>&quot;All right, youngster, we&#39;ll try it,&quot; Divine Brachyura growls, swinging back around to face her control panel.  You cheer silently behind her; it wouldn&#39;t do to let her hear.  As you&#39;re speeding away from the battle, she radios Commander Kelpbane to let him in on the plan.  He sounds skeptical, but agrees to tell the rest of the ships to flee when they see the deathstarfish approaching.</p>

<p>Divine Brachyura says nothing to you during the flight toward the deathstarfish.  You watch it growing larger and larger in the viewscreen, until you&#39;re within weapons range.  Divine Brachyura nods in your direction.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she growls, &quot;we&#39;re no planet, but this should get its attention.&quot;  Before you know what she&#39;s about, Divine Brachyura has sent all the bombs on the ship speeding toward the deathstarfish, following up with a long blast from the xanthidean lasers.  When she immediately turns the ship around and starts speeding back toward Verru, you gasp.</p>

<p>&quot;Divine Brachyura,&quot; you cry, &quot;we don&#39;t even know if the thing noticed us!  Why have we turned around?  What if it doesn&#39;t follow?&quot;</p>

<p>Divine Brachyura throws a quelling claw in your direction; you duck out of the way, avoiding a fractured skull by centimeters.</p>

<p>&quot;What if it <i>does</i> follow,&quot; your leader growls.  She&#39;s switched the screen to show the view behind the ship rather than in front of it.  You peer into it, watching as the bombs and lasers explode against the deathstarfish&#39;s surface.  And then, before your brain has time to register the change, the deathstarfish is moving.  It&#39;s growing larger in the viewscreen, which means it&#39;s moving straight toward your ship at an incredible speed.  Divine Brachyura grunts. &quot;Yes,&quot; she says calmly,  &quot;it looks like we got its attention.&quot;</p>

<p>When you faint dead away and crumple to the floor, Divine Brachyura barely notices.  She radios Commander Kelpbane, and as you drift completely away from consciousness, you hear her telling him to get everyone clear.  Maybe you could <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2B1">fight your way back to awareness</a>; on  the other hand, it would be nice to <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2B2">sleep through whatever&#39;s going to happen next</a>.</p>
