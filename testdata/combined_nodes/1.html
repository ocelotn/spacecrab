<p>You&#39;re in the ship again, drifting.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re supposed to be scouting the sector for Crabbers, by order of the Divine Brachyura herself.  Your Cockleshell 2600 is equipped with chelae for pincering at close range, as well as xanthidaen lasers and long-range bombs for space battle.</p>  

<p>&quot;Scuttle out and look about,&quot; Divine Brachyura ordered, waving you out of her audience hall.  Even in humanoid form, she thought like a true crustacean. &quot;You never know where carcinologists might be hiding.  You never know when they&#39;ll be right on our doorstep!&quot;</p>

<p> Actually, you <i>do</i> know.  Crabbers haven&#39;t been spotted in this sector since long before you were born.  These missions are boring and pointless, and you&#39;d tell Her Divine Crustaceasness that, too...if you weren&#39;t terrified of her.  You shake your head.  You really ought to <a data-dest1="2.node" href="spacecrab.pl?2.node">march into that audience hall and tell Divine Brachyura that she&#39;s acting like a hermit crab</a>, paranoid and fearful.</p>

<p>In any case, you spend all your scouting trips exploring rather than scouting.  There&#39;s more to see even in this one sector than you could discover in a lifetime.  Straight ahead, <a data-dest1="3.node" href="spacecrab.pl?3.node">something sparkles green and blue in the distance.</a>  And Verru, nearby Sessilia&#39;s second moon, is transmitting <a data-dest1="4.node" href="spacecrab.pl?4.node">some kind of signal</a>—which is odd, since nothing lives there. </p> 

<p>Already, you&#39;re faced with choices.</p>
