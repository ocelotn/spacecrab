<p>You turn your ship around and fly straight back to the docking port nearest the Royal Compound.  Steeling yourself, you stride through the audience hall doors.  The guards don&#39;t stop you; they know you for a loyal servant to Her Divine Crustaceasness.</p>

<p>You march up to the throne, where Divine Brachyura sits.  She looks at you expectantly, and you take a deep breath.</p>

<p>&quot;Divine Brachyura,&quot; you declare, standing squarely before her, &quot;you are acting like a hermit crab, paranoid and fearful.&quot;</p>

<p>Divine Brachyura throws both arms into the air, weaving them as though she has pincers even in human form.</p> 

<p>&quot;BLAAAAASPHEMY,&quot; she roars, glaring down at you from the throne, and suddenly her waving arms begin to look harder, more clawlike.  She&#39;s making the change; her robe tears as she shifts into crabform.  Clacking her pincers meaningfully, Divine Brachyura scuttles down from her throne and slams her dominant claw over your head, crushing your skull and sending gray brain matter flying in all directions.</p>

<p> If only your human form had included a nice, hard exoskeleton!  Ah, well.</p>

THE END.
