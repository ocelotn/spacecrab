<p>You shift gears and push a few pertinent buttons, and your ship zips forward.  Once again, you feel thankful that you&#39;ve got a ship produced on Emarginata, where they don&#39;t insist on sideways motion.  &#39;Natas might be kind of odd, sure, but it&#39;s nice to actually be able to see where you&#39;re going.</p>

<p>The sparkling green and blue colors fill more of the sky as your ship glides nearer to it.  A blue star, perhaps...?  Not uncommon, really, but...no, no, there&#39;s too much green for that.  And the sparkling is truly odd.  Toggling the telescoping lenses in the underside of the ship, you try to get a closer look at the surface of the thing—assuming it has a surface.  Peering at the telescope&#39;s display screen, you see that it <i>is</i> solid, at least.  Circular indentations covering the object.  Craters?  Drained lakes? </p>

<p>You&#39;ll have to <a data-dest1id="node3A" href="spacecrab.pl?node3A">get closer</a> if you want to find out more.  If there are hostile inhabitants on or near the object, however--and it <i>does</i> looks large enough for a minor space station--they might detect you.  You probably ought to <a data-dest1id="node3B" href="spacecrab.pl?node3B">turn around now</a>; one little Cockleshell 2600 can&#39;t handle much space fighting.</p>

<p>Pondering your situation, you notice the dashboard clock.  Hey, it&#39;s lunchtime!  Surely there&#39;s time for <a data-dest1id="node3C" href="spacecrab.pl?node3C">a nice coral polyp and algae sandwich</a> before making any big decisions!  Your stomach rumbles meaningfully.</p>
