<p>Your curiosity overwhelms you (and your good sense does not).  You maintain your course toward the sparkling green and blue object and increase your speed.  You&#39;ve come too far to turn back before finding out what this thing is!  It could be incredible!  It could be spectacular!  If you turn back now, you&#39;ll never know.</p>

<p>By the time the ink begins to cover your viewports, you&#39;re too close to pull away.  Ah, yes, of course.  A space octopus.  You should have known, really.  The blue and green sparkles were its camouflage, the circular markings were the suction cups on what you now see to be tentacles.  The space octopus  pulls you close, drills into the Cockleshell 2600, and injects poison into the cabin.  As you lose consciousness, you wonder whether being eaten by a space octopus will hurt more or less than being eaten by a crabber would have. </p>

<p>THE END.</p>
