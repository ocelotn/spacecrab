<p>3 minutes.  You&#39;ve got training—Space Crab Army training.</p>
	
<p>You nearly turn purple from holding your breath so long, but you manage to program the failing Cockleshell to eject you through the air lock, giving you a nice boost towards home.  Your entry into open space triggers your shapeshifting reflexes, and you immediately shift into crabform.  As far as you can tell, the space octopus doesn&#39;t even notice your escape.  Looking back, you see it probing around inside the Cockleshell with two long tentacles.  It looks like a kid with two fingers in the peanut butter without jar. </p>

<p>You shudder, remembering that in this case you are the peanut butter.</p>

<p>You propel yourself homeward as best you can; it takes longer without the Cockleshell, but at least you&#39;re alive.  You scuttle doggedly onward, sights set on Brachya, trying not to think about what Divine Brachyura will say when she finds out you&#39;ve lost one of her ships.  Emarginatas charge a claw and a leg for their ships, and if Divine Brachyura docks your pay for the cost of the Cockleshell 2600, you won&#39;t make a penny for years.  Ah, well.  Mother and Dad won&#39;t let you starve.  Hopefully.</p>
<p>You pass rather close to Verru on your journey homeward, and without any warning you see three strange ships heading toward you.  They&#39;ve clearly come from Verru, which is odd because, aside from that weird signal you picked up earlier, there&#39;s been no sign of activity on Verru before.  The ships don&#39;t see you—you&#39;re just one space crab drifting through the vastness of space, without the Cockleshell—but you stare hard at them, trying to get some idea of who these ships could belong to.</p>

<p>And then you see it, and it&#39;s so obvious that you slam a claw onto your own head, appalled at how dense you&#39;ve been: these ships are shaped like crabbers.  You&#39;ve never actually <i>seen</i> a crabber, true, but these ships look just like the pictures from your classes at Space Crab Academy.</p>

<p>Frantic to get this information to Divine Brachyura, you strain to move faster toward home.  Damn that space octopus!  This is no time to be shipless.</p>

<p>When you finally reach Brachya, you don&#39;t even wait long enough for the shift back into humanoid form to begin.  You&#39;re quicker in crabform, anyway, and enough time&#39;s been wasted already.  You scuttle into the throne room and up the long walkway, stopping just below Divine Brachyura&#39;s royal dais.</p>

<p>Clacking your claws in agitation, you explain the situation to your leader. When you finally run out of details, you stand before the throne, panting and clacking, waiting for Divine Brachyura to start issuing orders.</p>

<p>&quot;Very amusing, youngster,&quot; Divine Brachyura growls.  She, too, is in crabform; as the only one of the crabfolk who can take on that form at will, she often spends her audiences crustaceasly.  She stares down at you.  &quot;Fantastic tales will not replace a Cockleshell 2600. Your pay now belongs to me for the next several years.&quot;</p>   

<p>You stare back at Divine Brachyura in horror.  She doesn&#39;t believe you!  She&#39;s not going to send out the Army.  And you are never, ever going to have enough money to leave your parents&#39; house.  There must be <a data-dest1="node3C2A"> something you can say to convince her</a>!  On the other hand...perhaps there isn&#39;t.  Perhaps you&#39;d better <a data-dest1="node3C2B">resign yourself to your fate</a>.</p>
