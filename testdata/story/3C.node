<p>Ooh, lunch time!  You put the Cockleshell 2600 in neutral and let it idle, then reach around 	behind your seat and pull out your lunch pail.  Tipping the pail up, you empty some sand into your mouth.  </p>

<p>Stomach full, you lean back in your seat and ponder your options.  Soon you&#39;re snoring. </p>

<p>By the time you notice anything going on, the space octopus is already drilling into the Cockleshell 2600.  It pipes a noxious mucus into the ship, intent on knocking you out and pulling your succulent body out of the Cockleshell and into its gaping maw.  You struggle to stay awake, holding your breath as you attempt to release the airlock and escape into crabform.</p>

<p>How long can you hold your breath?</p>

<a data-dest1="3C1.node">You can hold your breath for 20 seconds, give or take.<br />
<a data-dest1="3C2.node">You can hold your breath for 3 minutes.  You&#39;ve got training -- Space Crab Army training.<br />
<a data-dest1="3C3.node"> You&#39;re a space crab!  You can hold your breath all day.<br />
