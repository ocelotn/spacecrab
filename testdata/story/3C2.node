<p>3 minutes.  You&#39;ve got training -- Space Crab Army training.</p>
	
<p>You nearly turn purple from holding your breath so long, but you manage to program the failing Cockleshell to eject you through the air lock, giving you a nice boost towards home.  Your entry into open space triggers your shapeshifting reflexes, and you immediately shift into crabform.  As far as you can tell, the space octopus doesn&#39;t even notice your escape.  Looking back, you see it probing around inside the Cockleshell with two long tentacles.  It looks like a kid with two fingers in the peanut butter jar. </p>

<p>You shudder, remembering that in this case you are the peanut butter.</p>
