<p>You shift gears and push a few pertinent buttons, and your ship zips forward.  Once again, you feel thankful that you&#39;ve got a Cockleshell 2600.  Cockleshells are produced on Emarginata, where they don&#39;t insist on sideways motion.  &#39;Natas might be kind of odd, sure, but you&#39;d take one of their forward-motion ships any day of the week.  It might be counterintuitive to say so (and you&#39;d never say it in front of Mother or Father, of course), but it&#39;s nice to actually be able to see where you&#39;re going.</p>

<p>The sparkling green and blue colors fill more of the sky as your ship glides nearer to it.  A blue star, perhaps...?  Not uncommon, really, but...no, no, there&#39;s too much green for that.   Blue starts are undeniably, singularly blue.  And the sparkling is truly odd.  Toggling the telescoping lenses in the underside of the Cockleshell, you try to get a closer look at the surface of the thing—assuming it has a surface.  Peering at the telescope&#39;s display screen, you can see that it <i>is</i> solid, at least.  Circular indentations cover the object.  Craters?  Drained lakes? </p>

<p>You&#39;ll have to <a data-dest1="node3A">get closer</a> if you want to find out more.  If there are hostile inhabitants on or near the object, however—and it <i>does</i> looks large enough for a minor space station—they might detect you.  You probably ought to <a data-dest1="node3B">turn around now</a>; one little Cockleshell 2600 can&#39;t handle much space fighting.</p>  You frown down at the buttons that control your lasers and bombs.  If only the Emarginata manufacturers had seen fit to provide a little more firepower, you could boldly scuttle where no crab had scuttled before.

<p>Pondering your situation, you notice the dashboard clock.  Hey, it&#39;s lunchtime!  Surely you can spare a few minutes for <a data-dest1="node3C">a nice coral polyp and algae sandwich</a> before making any big decisions!  Your stomach rumbles meaningfully.</p>
