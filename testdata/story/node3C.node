<p>Ooh, lunch time!  You put the Cockleshell 2600 in neutral and let it idle, then reach around behind your seat and pull out your lunch pail.  Mother filled it this morning as she does every morning, and you know you&#39;ll find some tasty polyps and algae layered into the pound or so of sand.  Tipping the pail up, you empty some sand into your mouth. Yes!  Mmmmm, polyps!  No one packs a lunch like Mother.  You tip the pail up again.</p>

<p>Stomach full, you lean back in your seat and ponder your options.  Soon you&#39;re snoring, drifting peacefully in space.</p>

<p>You wake to the sound of the space octopus drilling into the Cockleshell 2600.  Ah, yes, of course!  A space octopus.  You should have known, really.  The blue and green sparkles were its camouflage, the circular markings were the suction cups on what you now realize are tentacles.   It pipes a noxious mucus into the ship, intent on knocking you out and pulling your succulent body out of the Cockleshell and into its gaping maw.  You struggle to stay awake, holding your breath as you attempt to release the airlock and escape into crabform.  Breathing in crabform works any time,  any space...even <i>outer</i>space.  It&#39;s too bad you can&#39;t control the shift into crabform; only Divine Brachyura, herself, can manage that.  Like all the other lesser crabfolk, your crabform must be triggered by contact with deep space.  If you can hold out against the space octopus&#39; noxious gases long enough to eject from the Cockleshell, you might just survive.</p>

<p>How long can you hold your breath?</p>

<a data-dest1="node3C1">You can hold your breath for 20 seconds, give or take.<br />
<a data-dest1="node3C2">You can hold your breath for 3 minutes.  You&#39;ve got trainingâ€”Space Crab Army training.<br />
<a data-dest1="node3C3"> You&#39;re a space crab!  You can hold your breath all day.<br />
