<p>&quot;This is no fantastic tale,&quot; you insist, leaning in toward Divine Brachyura, willing her to understand and believe.  &quot;There are crabbers on Verru, and you must send out the Space Crab Army or else we&#39;re all DOOMED!&quot;</p><p>

</p><p>You raise your claws over your head, snapping them open and shut as your emotions run wild.  Unsure of your intent, Divine Brachyura takes no chances.  Before you see what&#39;s coming, she has raised one massive claw and slammed it down to crush your head.</p>

<p>Despite the hard exoskeleton your crabform provides, Divine Brachyura&#39;s mighty claw immediately kills you.</p> 

<p>THE END.</p>
