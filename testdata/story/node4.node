<p>You shift gears and jab a few pertinent buttons, and your ship drifts toward Verru, Sessilia&#39;s second moon.  You&#39;ve programmed your ship to record the signal coming from the dark moon; now you set it to play the signal on the ship&#39;s internal speakers.</p>

<p>Orbiting Verru and monitoring the signal, you realize you&#39;re sitting in plain view of anyone who might pass by.  Perhaps you should <a data-dest1id="node4A">cloak the Cockleshell</a> while you wait for the computer to decipher the signal.  Just as a precaution.</p>
