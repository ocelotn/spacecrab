<p>Safety first!  It only means pushing a button, after all.  You cloak the ship, and it&#39;s a damn good thing you did.   Moments after cloaking, you see three ships come blazing toward you; you gape at them as they zip by and disappear into the distance.   Judging by their speed and angle, they&#39;ve just come from Verru.  You don&#39;t recognize the ships, so they&#39;re obviously not of crustaceas design.</p> 

<p>What could be happening down there on that little moon?  You stare at it on your screen, as though the view from space is going to tell you anything.  You ought to <a data-dest1="node4A1">fly straight home, tell Divine Brachyura what you&#39;ve seen, and help her raise the Space Crab Army</a>.  You&#39;re just one person in a Cockleshell 2600.  You need reinforcements.</p>

<p>On the other claw, what&#39;s the use of returning home without proof that something&#39;s going on?  Will Divine Brachyura even believe you, if all you&#39;ve got is your own statement that you&#39;ve seen a few ships?  Maybe you should <a data-dest1="node4A2">eject from the Cockleshell and go planetside to explore.</a></p>
