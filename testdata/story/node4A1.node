<p>After checking carefully with your ship&#39;s scanners to make sure no more crabber vessels are nearby, you speed off toward Brachya.  You plan out what to say to Divine Brachyura, envisioning yourself by her side as she announces that the crabbers have come and the Space Crab Army must arise and defeat the enemy.</p> 

<p>&quot;This young crab,&quot; she will proclaim to the gathered masses, &quot;has saved us all, giving us the time to organize and rise up to face the wicked carcinologists!&quot;</p> 

<p> When the Cockleshell finally reaches Brachya, you are too impatient to wait for it to dock. You set the auto-docking mechanism and eject into space, crabform immediately kicking in.  You launch yourself down toward the surface of the planet and hit the ground scuttling, moving full speed toward Divine Brachyura&#39;s throne room.  Without hesitation you bear down on her, stopping just below her royal dais.  Her Crustaceasness is also in crabform.  As the only one among the crabfolk who can take on the form at will, she often spends her audiences thus.  She stares down at you from her throne.</p>

<p>&quot;Divine Brachyura,&quot; you pant, &quot;I bring you urgent news.  The crabbers have set up an outpost on Verru, Sessilia&#39;s smaller moon!  Their ships fly in and out at will.  We must raise the Army!&quot;</p>

<p>You stare up at your leader, waiting for her to begin issuing commands.  Or perhaps she will want to shower praises upon you first, for your loyalty and attention to duty.</p>

<p>&quot;Child,&quot; Divine Brachyura growls, &quot;you may not know it, but I hear such ridiculous tales all the time.  You youngsters seem to find it highly amusing to run about shrieking, &#39;The crabbers are coming!  The crabbers are coming!&#39;, but this court has no time for games.&quot;  She frowns down at you.  &quot;Most likely you&#39;re overtired.  Being overtired seems to get you youngsters quite...giddy.&quot; She pauses, then waves a claw benevolently.  &quot;Go home, take a cup of tea, and get to bed.  You may take up patrolling your sector again tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p>Your eyes bulge.  She doesn&#39;t believe you!  She&#39;s not going to raise the army or anything.  The crabbers will come and boil everyone alive, and Divine Brachyura won&#39;t know until too late that you were telling the truth.</p>

<p>Tea! TEA!  Forget it.  You ought to <a data-dest1="node4A1A">sneak back into the Cockleshell 2600 and go get proof that the crabbers are on Verru</a>.  Then Divine Brachyura will have to believe you!</p>

<p>Or...well, maybe you should do as Divine Brachyura says.  You do feel rather tired, and a cup of <a data-dest1="node4A1B">tea sounds like just the thing</a>.  She&#39;s never going to believe you, no matter what you do.  Perhaps you should drop it and hope that the crabbers don&#39;t find Brachya.</p>
