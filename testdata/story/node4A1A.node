<p>You agree with Divine Brachyura that you must be overtired, and you bow yourself out of her presence.  Then you turn and scuttle for the Cockleshell, climbing inside and taking off before anyone can question you.  None of the dock guards know you&#39;ve been ordered home, anyway.</p>

<p>You engage the ship&#39;s cloaking mechanism and speed back toward Verru.  You put the Cockleshell in orbit around the moon, take a deep breath, and set the ship to eject you into space.  When your body hits the outside air, you immediately undergo the shift into crabform.  As programmed, the ship has lobbed you toward the moon&#39;s surface, some few yards distant from where you think the ships are coming and going.  You land near enough to see lights and movement, but far enough that no one detects your presence.  Nice aim, Cockleshell 2600!</p>

<p>As quietly as possible, you scuttle toward the lights and action.  Verru&#39;s moon doesn&#39;t offer too much cover, but there are just enough scrubby bushes and scrawny trees for you to hide behind as you make your way toward the crabbers&#39; base.  Furthermore, you notice when you get close enough that there don&#39;t appear to be very many crabbers wandering around.</p>  

<p>Perhaps they&#39;re all inside that massive building, the somewhat narrow one that stetches into the distance.  It&#39;s got rows of windows; maybe you should <a data-dest1="node4A1A1">scuttle over and take a peek</a>.</p>

<p>Or maybe...no, there&#39;s really no other option, here.  You need to <a data-dest1="node4A1A1">scuttle over and take a peek</a>.</p>
