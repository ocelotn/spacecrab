<div class="story" fg="FG_SpaceCrabShipInterior.png" id="node4A1A">
<p>You agree with Divine Brachyura that you must be overtired, and you bow yourself out of her presence.  Then you turn and scuttle for the Cockleshell, climbing inside and taking off before anyone can question you.  None of the dock guards know you&#39;ve been ordered home, anyway.</p>

<p>You engage the ship&#39;s cloaking mechanism and speed back toward Verru.  You put the Cockleshell in orbit around the moon, take a deep breath, and set the ship to eject you into space.  When your body hits the outside air, you immediately undergo the shift into crabform.  As programmed, the ship has lobbed you toward the moon&#39;s surface, some few yards distant from where you think the ships are coming and going.  You land near enough to see lights and movement, but far enough that no one detects your presence.  Nice aim, Cockleshell 2600!</p>

<p>As quietly as possible, you scuttle toward the lights and action.  Verru&#39;s moon doesn&#39;t offer too much cover, but there are just enough scrubby bushes and scrawny trees for you to hide behind as you make your way toward the crabbers&#39; base.  Furthermore, you notice when you get close enough that there don&#39;t appear to be very many crabbers wandering around.</p>  

<p>Perhaps they&#39;re all inside that massive building, the somewhat narrow one that stetches into the distance.  It&#39;s got rows of windows; maybe you should <a data-dest1="node4A1A1">scuttle over and take a peek</a>.</p>

<p>Or maybe...no, there&#39;s really no other option, here.  You need to <a data-dest1="node4A1A1">scuttle over and take a peek</a>.</p>

<div bg="BG_CrabberBase.png" class="story" fg="FG_SpaceCrabHuman.png" id="node4A1A1">
<p> Oh, the horror!  Rows and rows of monstrous silver pots, as far as the eye can see.  Dozens of crabbers wander around inside the building, checking the pots, adding a dash of salt here and pepper there, filling ramekins with melted butter.  You&#39;ve heard all the crabber campfire stories; you know what those pots are for.</p>

<p>You pull yourself together and hold up your claw, recording an image of the room with your wrist device.   No one will be able to deny that the crabbers have landed on Verru.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;ve got to <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A">get out of here and take the Cockleshell back to Brachya</a>.  To be honest, though, it&#39;s tempting to <a data-dest1="node4A1A1B">keep gawking like an idiot</a>.  Crabbers have been legends and scary stories to you until now.  It&#39;s hard to tear your eyes away.</p>

<div bg="BG_SpaceCrabQueenPalace.png" class="story" fg="FG_SpaceCrabHuman.png" id="node4A1A1A" mg="MG_SpaceCrabQueen.png">
<p>With the proof safely recorded on your wrist device, you scuttle off into the underbrush. When you&#39;ve gotten a good distance away from the crabber encampment, you launch yourself back toward the Cockleshell 2600.  Once aboard, you set your destination to Brachya and head home at the highest speed the Cockleshell can handle.</p>

<p>When you finally get back to Brachya, you race to the audience hall and interrupt the councilor speaking to Divine Brachyura.  You&#39;re still in crabform; you can&#39;t be bothered to wait for the effects of your direct contact with space to wear off.</p>

<p>&quot;Divine Brachyura,&quot; you pant, chest heaving, eyes wild, &quot;the crabbers—...uhh, carcinologists are coming!  I saw them, and I have proof!&quot;  You continue babbling, growing more and more incoherent, as Divine Brachyura and the huffy councilor stare at you.  After a moment, Her Crustaceasness reaches out and clamps a claw around your wrist.  She yanks you toward her and jabs a button on your wrist device, then watches the recording you made of the crabber base.  Once she&#39;s seen the whole recording, Divine Brachyura unclamps your wrist and gestures to a nearby guard.</p>

<p>&quot;Find Commander Kelpbane,&quot; she growls. &quot;Do it yourself. I want him here within five minutes.&quot;  She watches the guard run from the room, then turns back to you.  You stand as straight and tall as you can, waiting for her to commend you and announce that you&#39;ll be leading the war effort by her side.  &quot;Youngster, you&#39;ve fulfilled your duty.  Go home, have a warm cup of tea, and put yourself to bed.  This is a job for cooler heads, now.&quot; She nods, then turns away to speak to the councilor still standing nearby.</p>

<p>You stare at the side of her head.  Go home?  Have some tea?  Impossible!  She wouldn&#39;t even know about the crabbers on Verru if not for you.  She can&#39;t count you out now.</p>

<p>Your options are three, and you&#39;ve got to make a decision quickly, before Divine Brachyura turns to find out why you&#39;re still standing around.  You could <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A1">protest her decision</a>, tell her you&#39;re not going to be sent to bed like a child, and hope she doesn&#39;t kill you for your impertinence; you could <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2">sneak onto one of the ships</a> that will be massing outside and preparing to fly into battle; or you could <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A3">go home, have a nice cup of tea, and go to bed</a> (it <i>has</i> been a long day, after all).</p>

<div bg="BG_SpaceCrabQueenPalace.png" class="story" fg="FG_SpaceCrabHuman.png" id="node4A1A1A1" mg="MG_SpaceCrabQueen.png">
<p>No, that&#39;s a terrible idea.  Divine Brachyura doesn&#39;t have any patience for impertinence.  You can&#39;t possibly confront her directly.  You need to <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A3">give up and go home</a>, or else <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2">do some sneaking</a>.</p>

<div class="story" id="node4A1A1A2">
<p>Though Divine Brachyura is no longer looking at you, you bow deeply and stalk out of the audience hall at a dignified pace.  Outside, you see that the ships of the Space Crab Army are already arriving; Commander Kelpbane must have sent out the call as soon as he got Divine Brachyura&#39;s summons.</p> 

<p> The nearest ship is a grand one, larger and more impressive than any of the others you&#39;ve seen thus far, and there appears to be no one guarding it.  You dash gleefully inside and look around.  Aha!  Toward the back, behind the pilot&#39;s chair and supplies rack, there&#39;s just enough space for a space crab stowaway.  Hearing voices behind you, you dive for it, wedging yourself in behind the supplies.</p>

<p>Your timing is superb.  Just as you stop rustling and decide you&#39;re well enough hidden, two sets of heavy footsteps clomp up the passageway and through the hatch.  You can&#39;t see anything; you&#39;ve wedged yourself in with your face against the wall, your back to the room.  Stupid, stupid, stupid!</p>

<p>&quot;I will board my ship and await your orders, ma&#39;am,&quot; a familiar voice says crisply.  Commander Kelpbane!  In your mind&#39;s eye, you see him snapping a salute.  Back in Academy, the kids all tried to approximate his salutes.  They were the snappiest salutes in the Space Crab Army, the envy of officers and enlisted alike. You&#39;ll never get your salutes up to his standard.  In fact, Mother was saying just the other day—...Ma&#39;am?  Who would Commander Kelpbane address as ma&#39;am, unless...</p> 

<p>&quot;All right, commander,&quot; you hear Divine Brachyura growl, &quot;I&#39;ll be in touch once we&#39;re in the air.  Be prepared.&quot;</p>

<p>The hatch snaps shut behind Commander Kelpbane, and as the ship rumbles to life, you wish you&#39;d gone home for that nice cup of tea.  Of course you just had to climb into the biggest, grandest ship on the field. Why hadn&#39;t you realized that Divine Brachyura would be leading the battle herself?  The biggest, most impressive ship would obviously be hers.  And now you&#39;re stuck here, just you and Divine Brachyura, heading into space together.</p>

<p>If she ever realizes you&#39;ve stowed away on her ship, Divine Brachyura will kill you on the spot.  <i>If her third pincer&#39;s clacking</i>, you think inanely, remember the song you and your classmates used to sing about Divine Brachyura back in Space Crab Academy, <i>you&#39;d best be backing....AWAAAAAY!</i>  Your leader isn&#39;t known for her mild temperament.</p>

<p>Divine Brachyura radios Commander Kelpbane once the flight is underway.  She tells him her plans, the maneuvers she wants carried out, her expectations for each wing of ships.  The commander mostly listens, adding opinions here and there.  You&#39;ve never been trained to lead armies; most of what they say washes over you as words and more words.</p>

<p>Battle begins more quickly than you had expected.  One moment the ship is flying smoothly through the air under Divine Brachyura&#39;s expert claw, and the next moment it&#39;s rocking under enemy fire, Divine Brachyura roaring into her microphone, flashes of light from enemy bombs reaching you even behind and beneath the supplies rack.  You poke your nose up and around the baggage, hoping to get a better view of what&#39;s going on.  Divine Brachyura&#39;s busy, and you doubt she&#39;ll be paying attention to the cargo.</p>

<p>From what you can see out the ship&#39;s main viewport, things aren&#39;t looking good.  Battle&#39;s only been joined for a few minutes, and already things are out of control.  Divine Brachyura continues to roar into her mic, and you hear static and occasional snatches of Commander Kelpbane&#39;s voice in response.  As you watch, crabship after crabship explodes in the air, victims of the advancing crabber vessels.  The crabbers must have expected to be discovered and attacked, or else they&#39;re simply more wary than your own folk and always maintain a strong perimeter.</p>

<p>Things do not look good for the crab nation of Brachya.</p>

<p>Bedamned with Divine Brachyura&#39;s reaction, you&#39;ve got to do <i>something</i>!  You rack your brains for answers, squinching your eyes shut against the image of dying crabships, concentrating hard.  Your eyes blink wide again as ideas begin forming in your mind.  What about... <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2A">the space octopus</a>!  Perhaps you can lead it back here and aim it at the crabbers!  If you can warn your own people to get out of the way, surely the space octopus will grab whatever&#39;s nearest.</p>

<p>Perhaps not.  It was incredibly fast, after all, when you encountered it before.  Most likely it would shovel you and Divine Brachyura into its maw, and you&#39;d never get a chance to send it after the crabbers.  What else, what else...AHA!  <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2B">The deathstarfish</a>!  If you can tempt it toward the crabber moonbase, perhaps it will decide to eat it!  After all, it hasn&#39;t eaten a planet during your lifetime, or during your parents&#39; lifetimes.  It must be hungry, right?  You wonder if Verru looks appetizing to a creature that eats planets.

</p><p>Wait, where are these ideas coming from?  You can&#39;t lead your people toward a space octopus, and you certainly can&#39;t lead them toward the deathstarfish, can you? You square your shoulders.  Well, if this is the end, then you&#39;ll face it with pride.  If you can&#39;t lead your people to victory, at least you can <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2C">lead them in song.</a></p>

4A1A1A2A
<div class="story" id="node4A1A1A2A">
<p>You leap out from behind the gear rack, heedless of your own safety.</p>  

<p>&quot;Divine Brachyura,&quot; you cry, startling your leader.  She turns to glare at you, claws clacking in outrage.  You gulp and continue, hoping she lets you have your say before she kills you.  &quot;Divine Brachyura, I have a plan!  This morning, while I was, uh, patrolling the sector, I encountered a space octopus.&quot;  You pause.  Divine Brachyura looks unimpressed thus far, and you rush to explain your idea.  &quot;What if we go find it again, and tempt it to come after the cra—...carcinologists!&quot;</p>

<p>Divine Brachyura stares at you for a moment.  Yes, yes, she looks intrigued.  She&#39;s going to go for it!  You&#39;re going to be remembered as the Space Crab Army cadet who won the battle against the crabbers of Verru through ingenuity and brilliant strategizing! </p> 

<p>You&#39;re beaming, eyes fixed on an internal landscape of cheering crowds and military medals, when Divine Brachyura slams a scornful claw over your head and kills you.  Muttering, she turns away from your crumpled carcass and goes back to directing the battle.</p>
<p>THE END.</p>

<div class="story" id="node4A1A1A2B">
<p>You leap out from behind the gear rack, heedless of your own safety.</p>  

<p>&quot;Divine Brachyura,&quot; you cry, startling your leader.  She turns to glare at you, claws clacking in outrage.  You gulp and continue, hoping she lets you have your say before she kills you.  &quot;Divine Brachyura, I have a plan!  THE DEATHSTARFISH!&quot;  You pause.  Divine Brachyura looks unimpressed, which startles you, but you rush to explain your idea.  &quot;What if we go, get its attention, and lead it here.  Surely, after waking from its hibernation, it will be hungry, won&#39;t it?  We can act as bait and lead it right here to Verru.  Once their base is destroyed, the cra—...carcinologists will scatter and retreat!&quot;</p>

<p>You stare at Divine Brachyura hopefully, waiting for her decision.  She&#39;s got to agree to do it, she&#39;s just got to!  If she doesn&#39;t, your people are doomed!  She&#39;s clacking her claws, she&#39;s glaring at you, but...</p>

<p>&quot;All right, youngster, we&#39;ll try it,&quot; Divine Brachyura growls, swinging back around to face her control panel.  You cheer silently behind her; it wouldn&#39;t do to let her hear.  As you&#39;re speeding away from the battle, she radios Commander Kelpbane to let him in on the plan.  He sounds skeptical, but agrees to tell the rest of the ships to flee when they see the deathstarfish approaching.</p>

<p>Divine Brachyura says nothing to you during the flight toward the deathstarfish.  You watch it growing larger and larger in the viewscreen, until you&#39;re within weapons range.  Divine Brachyura nods in your direction.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she growls, &quot;we&#39;re no planet, but this should get its attention.&quot;  Before you know what she&#39;s about, Divine Brachyura has sent all the bombs on the ship speeding toward the deathstarfish, following up with a long blast from the xanthidean lasers.  When she immediately turns the ship around and starts speeding back toward Verru, you gasp.</p>

<p>&quot;Divine Brachyura,&quot; you cry, &quot;we don&#39;t even know if the thing noticed us!  Why have we turned around?  What if it doesn&#39;t follow?&quot;</p>

<p>Divine Brachyura throws a quelling claw in your direction; you duck out of the way, avoiding a fractured skull by centimeters.</p>

<p>&quot;What if it <i>does</i> follow,&quot; your leader growls.  She&#39;s switched the screen to show the view behind the ship rather than in front of it.  You peer into it, watching as the bombs and lasers explode against the deathstarfish&#39;s surface.  And then, before your brain has time to register the change, the deathstarfish is moving.  It&#39;s growing larger in the viewscreen, which means it&#39;s moving straight toward your ship at an incredible speed.  Divine Brachyura grunts. &quot;Yes,&quot; she says calmly,  &quot;it looks like we got its attention.&quot;</p>

<p>When you faint dead away and crumple to the floor, Divine Brachyura barely notices.  She radios Commander Kelpbane, and as you drift completely away from consciousness, you hear her telling him to get everyone clear.  Maybe you could <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2B1">fight your way back to awareness</a>; on  the other hand, it would be nice to <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2B2">sleep through whatever&#39;s going to happen next</a>.</p>
</div>


4A1A1A2B1
<div class="story" id="node4A1A1A2B1">
<p>It&#39;s not easy, but you claw your way back to consciousness.  Whether your brilliant plan succeeds or not, you&#39;re going to see it through to the end.  You&#39;re going to stand proud, right here beside Divine Bra—...You glance around the cabin.  Where did Divine Brachyura go?  You boggle when you see her heading for the hatch.  She glances back and catches your eye.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she growls, &quot;so you&#39;re awake again, are you?  I suggest getting out of this ship, if you don&#39;t want to play appetizer to a deathstarfish.&quot;  She gestures toward the viewscreen.  The deathstarfish fills it.  &quot;It may turn its attentions to Verru afterwards, but for now it wants to kill whatever woke it up.&quot;  She turns away and, without another word, disappears out the airlock.</p>

<p>You scramble after Divine Brachyura, hoping she programmed the airlock to remain open long enough for you to slide out.  Yes, there you go, you reach the end of the passage and the ship lobs you out through the open door and into space, your crabform activating immediately, allowing you to breath freely and move at speed. At this size, you should be near invisible to something as mighty as a deathstarfish.</p>

<p>You scuttle after Divine Brachyura, still riding on the launch the ship gave you toward the Space Crab Army fleet.  When your leader slides gracefully into the opened hatch of the nearest ship, you scrabble in right behind her.  Commander Kelpbane greets you both from the cockpit of the ship, jumping up to tender his seat to Divine Brachyura.</p>

<p>For a few tense moments, you watch the deathstarfish skimming the blasted bits and pieces of Divine Brachyura&#39;s ship into its maw.  The SCA ships have backed away, and by now so have the crabber vessels.  <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2B1A">Will the monstrous creature turn its attention to Verru?</a></p>
</div>

<div class="story" id="node4A1A1A2B1A">
<p>Yes!  It appears to be turning toward the moon.  As you watch the screen, the deathstarfish seems to pulsate from within.  When the beam of energy erupts from its...mouth, perhaps, if that&#39;s its mouth...and slams into Verru, you gasp.  What had been a moon just a moment before has instantly become scraps and debris, through which the deathstarfish is cheerfully skimming.  You imagine it burbling happily to itself; it reminds you of your pet hamster, burrowing through a pile of food pellets and seeds.</p>

<p>Wait, what is it doing now?  You frown, and Commander Kelpbane leans in closer to the screen.  The deathstarfish is turning again.  Where could it be going...?  Oh!  Oh, dear.  You wince, watching the deathstarfish&#39;s energy beam blast apart Sessilia&#39;s smaller moon.  That&#39;s really too bad; the crabfolk of Sessilia had a settlement there, you know, and now they&#39;ve all been blown into deathstarfish food.  Still...it&#39;s just one settlement, and war demands sacrifice!</p>

<p>But...wait, the deathstarfish isn&#39;t even skimming the debris this time, it&#39;s just turning again.  You have a feeling you know what&#39;s about to happen next, but you can&#39;t tear your eyes from the screen.  The deathstarfish focuses on Sessilia, pulsates for a moment, and blasts the planet just as it blasted both moons.  Well, that&#39;s not ideal.</p>

<p>After munching through the chunks of destroyed planet, this time the deathstarfish slowly turns toward the piece of space from which it had come.  You breathe a relieved sigh as it slowly slips out of view, leaving the crabber ships to flee and the Space Crab Army to return home victorious. (Except for that whole blowing up Sessilia thing, but, I mean, it&#39;s not <i>your</i> planet, and it could&#39;ve been worse!)</p>

<p>When you arrive back on Brachya and climb out of the ship behind Divine Brachya and Commander Kelpbane, the masses have gathered to hear the outcome of the battle.  It&#39;s just as you imagined!  Divine Brachyura will announce to one and all how you saved crabdom through your brilliance and bravery.  You watch impatiently as she steps forward to address the crowd.</p>

<p>&quot;My people,&quot; Divine Brachyura booms, projecting to be heard over the rustlings and whispers of the people.  &quot;The carcinologists thought to boil us for dinner, but instead they earned themselves a mouthful of razorsharp claw!&quot;  She raised up one of her own claws to the roaring acclaim of the crowd.  &quot;Let us learn a lesson from this, that we must remain ever vigilant, lest we be taken by surprise when we least expect it.  But, for today, it is a time to celebrate!  The enemy is routed, and we thrive!&quot;</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it.  To the sound of thunderous and ongoing applause, Divine Brachyura heads away toward her throne room.  You gape after her, shocked and puzzled.  No words of thanks for you, the hero who figured out how to defeat the crabbers when all seemed lost?</p>

<p>No.  No, that&#39;s unnacceptable, and you&#39;re not going to stand for it.  You&#39;re going to <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2B1A1">make that hermit crab of a Brachyura (Divine!  Pah!) acknowledge you in front of everyone</a>.  You deserve it!</p>

<p>Or maybe you don&#39;t.  All you really did was stow away on a ship and make one little suggestion, and then Divine Brachyura and Commander Kelpbane took care of the action.  And what does fame matter, anyway?  Your planet is safe now; the crabbers have fled your sector of space.  Isn&#39;t that what&#39;s important?  Maybe you should <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2B1A2">keep your trap shut and join the party, which is clearly getting underway as you stand around moping.  You see a huge barrel of ale being rolled down the street, and a few crabs have already started singing a victory song.</a></p>

<p>You let yourself drift into oblivion, hoping that when you wake up everything will be taken care of: the deathstarfish will have eaten Verru, the crabbers will be gone, and Divine Brachyura will have had someone drag you home to bed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, what happens instead is that Divine Brachyura realizes the deathstarfish will most likely destroy your ship before turning its attention to Verru (your ship being the thing that nettled it in the first place, after all).  She sets the ship to eject her into space, forgetting all about you until she&#39;s already clear of the vessel.  She shrugs and scuttles away toward the nearest crabship.</p>

<p>On the bright side, you don&#39;t feel a thing when the deathstarfish blows you to tiny bits and skims the floating pieces into its maw.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Hail to thee, Brachya, pearl within the shell—</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Before you make it all the way through the first line, Divine Brachyura recovers her wits and slams you over the head with one doughty claw.  You die with a proud smile on your face; muttering, Divine Brachyura shoves your carcass off the control panel and goes back to directing the battle.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to have to present Divine Brachyura with evidence that something fishy is going on with Verru, and the only way to do that is to go record some images with your handy wrist device.  You won&#39;t actually have wrists when you use it, because you&#39;ll be in crabform. You spend a moment pondering this irony, then take yourself firmly in claw.  You&#39;re stalling!  There&#39;s no time for nervous dithering.  You tap out the proper commands and the Cockleshell sends you flying out through the airlock.  Crabform kicks in immediately, turning you into an independent space-worthy unit, small but hardy.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take you long to reach Verru; the Cockleshell lobbed you out of the airlock with force, sending you sailing toward the small moon. As you near the surface, you employ claws and legs to steer yourself to a landing a few yards away from what you&#39;ve identified as a landing strip.  You want to be close enough that reaching the crabber base won&#39;t take an hour, but far enough away that you don&#39;t land in the middle of a crabber audience.  You gauge your descent to perfection, of course, and land among scrubby bushes and trees just outside the crabber compound.</p>

<p>You scuttle closer, ducking behind Verru&#39;s scrubby shrubberies as best you can.  Surprisingly, there aren&#39;t very many crabbers puttering around, though you peer carefully at every nook and cranny you think could contain a stealthy crabber.  You see a few crabbers off in the distance, but that&#39;s all. Odd!</p>

<p>Perhaps they&#39;re inside that long building, the one stretching off into the distance.  It does appear to be the centerpiece of the crabber encampment, and, conveniently, its walls are lined with windows.  You take a deep breath, steel yourself, and <a data-dest1="node4A1A1">scuttle up to the nearest one, poking your head up to peer inside</a>.

<p>Cloak?  No way.  There&#39;s no one out here!  <i>You&#39;re</i> not a paranoid hermit crab.</p>

<p>Wait—what was that?  The Cockleshell&#39;s main viewscreen blinks wildly, and a frantic bleeping issues from the internal speakers.  Three ships approaching, and they&#39;re coming in fast!  They&#39;ve clearly seen you, and they&#39;re not opening a frequency to hail you.  You&#39;re under attack; you hesitate, unsure whether to <a data-dest1="node4B1">fight</a> or <a data-dest1="node4B2">flee</a>.</p>

<p>You raise the ship&#39;s shields and prepare to fire your xanthidaen lasers.  You&#39;re not going down without a fight!</p>

<p>You are, however, going down, because the Cockleshell 2600 really wasn&#39;t made for intense battle, and you <i>are</i> facing three enemy ships.  As their lasers destroy you, you wonder who they are and what they&#39;re doing on Verru.</p>

<p>Oh well!  Guess you&#39;ll never know.</p>

<p>THE END.</p>

<div class="story" id="node4B2" mg="MG_CrabberShipFleet.png">
<p>There&#39;s no way the Cockleshell 2600 can handle a fight against three enemy ships.  You desperately shift gears and send the Cockleshell flying homeward.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there&#39;s also no way the Cockleshell 2600 can outrun three enemy ships, either.  It wasn&#39;t build for fighting, it wasn&#39;t built for speed...as the enemy ships&#39; lasers destroy you, you wonder what the hell it <i>was</i> built for, anyway.</p>

<p>THE END.</p>
