<p> Oh, the horror!  Rows and rows of monstrous silver pots, as far as the eye can see.  Dozens of crabbers wander around inside the building, checking the pots, adding a dash of salt here and pepper there, filling ramekins with melted butter.  You&#39;ve heard all the crabber campfire stories; you know what those pots are for.</p>

<p>You pull yourself together and hold up your claw, recording an image of the room with your wrist device.   No one will be able to deny that the crabbers have landed on Verru.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;ve got to <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A">get out of here and take the Cockleshell back to Brachya</a>.  To be honest, though, it&#39;s tempting to <a data-dest1="node4A1A1B">keep gawking like an idiot</a>.  Crabbers have been legends and scary stories to you until now.  It&#39;s hard to tear your eyes away.</p>
