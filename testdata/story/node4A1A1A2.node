<p>Though Divine Brachyura is no longer looking at you, you bow deeply and stalk out of the audience hall at a dignified pace.  Outside, you see that the ships of the Space Crab Army are already arriving; Commander Kelpbane must have sent out the call as soon as he got Divine Brachyura&#39;s summons.</p> 

<p> The nearest ship is a grand one, larger and more impressive than any of the others you&#39;ve seen thus far, and there appears to be no one guarding it.  You dash gleefully inside and look around.  Aha!  Toward the back, behind the pilot&#39;s chair and supplies rack, there&#39;s just enough space for a space crab stowaway.  Hearing voices behind you, you dive for it, wedging yourself in behind the supplies.</p>

<p>Your timing is superb.  Just as you stop rustling and decide you&#39;re well enough hidden, two sets of heavy footsteps clomp up the passageway and through the hatch.  You can&#39;t see anything; you&#39;ve wedged yourself in with your face against the wall, your back to the room.  Stupid, stupid, stupid!</p>

<p>&quot;I will board my ship and await your orders, ma&#39;am,&quot; a familiar voice says crisply.  Commander Kelpbane!  In your mind&#39;s eye, you see him snapping a salute.  Back in Academy, the kids all tried to approximate his salutes.  They were the snappiest salutes in the Space Crab Army, the envy of officers and enlisted alike. You&#39;ll never get your salutes up to his standard.  In fact, Mother was saying just the other day—...Ma&#39;am?  Who would Commander Kelpbane address as ma&#39;am, unless...</p> 

<p>&quot;All right, commander,&quot; you hear Divine Brachyura growl, &quot;I&#39;ll be in touch once we&#39;re in the air.  Be prepared.&quot;</p>

<p>The hatch snaps shut behind Commander Kelpbane, and as the ship rumbles to life, you wish you&#39;d gone home for that nice cup of tea.  Of course you just had to climb into the biggest, grandest ship on the field. Why hadn&#39;t you realized that Divine Brachyura would be leading the battle herself?  The biggest, most impressive ship would obviously be hers.  And now you&#39;re stuck here, just you and Divine Brachyura, heading into space together.</p>

<p>If she ever realizes you&#39;ve stowed away on her ship, Divine Brachyura will kill you on the spot.  <i>If her third pincer&#39;s clacking</i>, you think inanely, remember the song you and your classmates used to sing about Divine Brachyura back in Space Crab Academy, <i>you&#39;d best be backing....AWAAAAAY!</i>  Your leader isn&#39;t known for her mild temperament.</p>

<p>Divine Brachyura radios Commander Kelpbane once the flight is underway.  She tells him her plans, the maneuvers she wants carried out, her expectations for each wing of ships.  The commander mostly listens, adding opinions here and there.  You&#39;ve never been trained to lead armies; most of what they say washes over you as words and more words.</p>

<p>Battle begins more quickly than you had expected.  One moment the ship is flying smoothly through the air under Divine Brachyura&#39;s expert claw, and the next moment it&#39;s rocking under enemy fire, Divine Brachyura roaring into her microphone, flashes of light from enemy bombs reaching you even behind and beneath the supplies rack.  You poke your nose up and around the baggage, hoping to get a better view of what&#39;s going on.  Divine Brachyura&#39;s busy, and you doubt she&#39;ll be paying attention to the cargo.</p>

<p>From what you can see out the ship&#39;s main viewport, things aren&#39;t looking good.  Battle&#39;s only been joined for a few minutes, and already things are out of control.  Divine Brachyura continues to roar into her mic, and you hear static and occasional snatches of Commander Kelpbane&#39;s voice in response.  As you watch, crabship after crabship explodes in the air, victims of the advancing crabber vessels.  The crabbers must have expected to be discovered and attacked, or else they&#39;re simply more wary than your own folk and always maintain a strong perimeter.</p>

<p>Things do not look good for the crab nation of Brachya.</p>

<p>Bedamned with Divine Brachyura&#39;s reaction, you&#39;ve got to do <i>something</i>!  You rack your brains for answers, squinching your eyes shut against the image of dying crabships, concentrating hard.  Your eyes blink wide again as ideas begin forming in your mind.  What about... <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2A">the space octopus</a>!  Perhaps you can lead it back here and aim it at the crabbers!  If you can warn your own people to get out of the way, surely the space octopus will grab whatever&#39;s nearest.</p>

<p>Perhaps not.  It was incredibly fast, after all, when you encountered it before.  Most likely it would shovel you and Divine Brachyura into its maw, and you&#39;d never get a chance to send it after the crabbers.  What else, what else...AHA!  <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2B">The deathstarfish</a>!

</p><p>Where are these ideas coming from?  You can&#39;t lead your people toward a space octopus, and you certainly can&#39;t lead them toward the deathstarfish, can you? You square your shoulders.  Well, if this is the end, then you&#39;ll face it with pride.  If you can&#39;t lead your people to victory, at least you can <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2C">lead them in song.</a></p>

<p>You burst from your hiding place, startling Divine Brachyura long enough to grab the mic out of her sturdy claw.  Clearing your throat, you burst into a full-throated rendition of the Brachyuran National Anthem:</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Hail to thee, Brachya, pearl within the shell—</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Before you make it all the way through the first line, Divine Brachyura recovers her wits and slams you over the head with one doughty claw.  You die with a proud smile on your face; muttering, Divine Brachyura shoves your carcass off the control panel and goes back to directing the battle.</p>

<p>THE END.</p>
