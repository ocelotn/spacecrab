<p>You leap out from behind the gear rack, heedless of your own safety.</p>  

<p>&quot;Divine Brachyura,&quot; you cry, startling your leader.  She turns to glare at you, claws clacking in outrage.  You gulp and continue, hoping she lets you have your say before she kills you.  &quot;Divine Brachyura, I have a plan!  This morning, while I was, uh, patrolling the sector, I encountered a space octopus.&quot;  You pause.  Divine Brachyura looks unimpressed thus far, and you rush to explain your idea.  &quot;What if we go find it again, and tempt it to come after the craâ€”...carcinologists!&quot;</p>

<p>Divine Brachyura stares at you for a moment.  Yes, yes, she looks intrigued.  She&#39;s going to go for it!  You&#39;re going to be remembered as the Space Crab Army cadet who won the battle against the crabbers of Verru through ingenuity and brilliant strategizing! </p> 

<p>You&#39;re beaming, eyes fixed on an internal landscape of cheering crowds and military medals, when Divine Brachyura slams a scornful claw over your head and kills you.  Muttering, she turns away from your crumpled carcass and goes back to directing the battle.</p>
<p>THE END.</p>
