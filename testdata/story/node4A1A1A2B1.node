<p>It&#39;s not easy, but you claw your way back to consciousness.  Whether your brilliant plan succeeds or not, you&#39;re going to see it through to the end.  You&#39;re going to stand proud, right here beside Divine Braâ€”...You glance around the cabin.  Where did Divine Brachyura go?  You boggle when you see her heading for the hatch.  She glances back and catches your eye.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she growls, &quot;so you&#39;re awake again, are you?  I suggest getting out of this ship, if you don&#39;t want to play appetizer to a deathstarfish.&quot;  She gestures toward the viewscreen.  The deathstarfish fills it.  &quot;It may turn its attentions to Verru afterwards, but for now it wants to kill whatever woke it up.&quot;  She turns away and, without another word, disappears out the airlock.</p>

<p>You scramble after Divine Brachyura, hoping she programmed the airlock to remain open long enough for you to slide out.  Yes, there you go, you reach the end of the passage and the ship lobs you out through the open door and into space, your crabform activating immediately, allowing you to breath freely and move at speed. At this size, you should be near invisible to something as mighty as a deathstarfish.</p>

<p>You scuttle after Divine Brachyura, still riding on the launch the ship gave you toward the Space Crab Army fleet.  When your leader slides gracefully into the opened hatch of the nearest ship, you scrabble in right behind her.  Commander Kelpbane greets you both from the cockpit of the ship, jumping up to tender his seat to Divine Brachyura.</p>

<p>For a few tense moments, you watch the deathstarfish skimming the blasted bits and pieces of Divine Brachyura&#39;s ship into its maw.  The SCA ships have backed away, and by now so have the crabber vessels.  <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2B1A">Will the monstrous creature turn its attention to Verru?</a></p>
