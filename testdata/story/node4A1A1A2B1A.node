<p>Yes!  It appears to be turning toward the moon.  As you watch the screen, the deathstarfish seems to pulsate from within.  When the beam of energy erupts from its...mouth, perhaps, if that&#39;s its mouth...and slams into Verru, you gasp.  What had been a moon just a moment before has instantly become scraps and debris, through which the deathstarfish is cheerfully skimming.  You imagine it burbling happily to itself; it reminds you of your pet hamster, burrowing through a pile of food pellets and seeds.</p>

<p>Wait, what is it doing now?  You frown, and Commander Kelpbane leans in closer to the screen.  The deathstarfish is turning again.  Where could it be going...?  Oh!  Oh, dear.  You wince, watching the deathstarfish&#39;s energy beam blast apart Sessilia&#39;s smaller moon.  That&#39;s really too bad; the crabfolk of Sessilia had a settlement there, you know, and now they&#39;ve all been blown into deathstarfish food.  Still...it&#39;s just one settlement, and war demands sacrifice!</p>

<p>But...wait, the deathstarfish isn&#39;t even skimming the debris this time, it&#39;s just turning again.  You have a feeling you know what&#39;s about to happen next, but you can&#39;t tear your eyes from the screen.  The deathstarfish focuses on Sessilia, pulsates for a moment, and blasts the planet just as it blasted both moons.  Well, that&#39;s not ideal.</p>

<p>After munching through the chunks of destroyed planet, this time the deathstarfish slowly turns toward the piece of space from which it had come.  You breathe a relieved sigh as it slowly slips out of view, leaving the crabber ships to flee and the Space Crab Army to return home victorious. (Except for that whole blowing up Sessilia thing, but, I mean, it&#39;s not <i>your</i> planet, and it could&#39;ve been worse!)</p>

<p>When you arrive back on Brachya and climb out of the ship behind Divine Brachya and Commander Kelpbane, the masses have gathered to hear the outcome of the battle.  It&#39;s just as you imagined!  Divine Brachyura will announce to one and all how you saved crabdom through your brilliance and bravery.  You watch impatiently as she steps forward to address the crowd.</p>

<p>&quot;My people,&quot; Divine Brachyura booms, projecting to be heard over the rustlings and whispers of the people.  &quot;The carcinologists thought to boil us for dinner, but instead they earned themselves a mouthful of razorsharp claw!&quot;  She raised up one of her own claws to the roaring acclaim of the crowd.  &quot;Let us learn a lesson from this, that we must remain ever vigilant, lest we be taken by surprise when we least expect it.  But, for today, it is a time to celebrate!  The enemy is routed, and we thrive!&quot;</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it.  To the sound of thunderous and ongoing applause, Divine Brachyura heads away toward her throne room.  You gape after her, shocked and puzzled.  No words of thanks for you, the hero who figured out how to defeat the crabbers when all seemed lost?</p>

<p>No.  No, that&#39;s unnacceptable, and you&#39;re not going to stand for it.  You&#39;re going to <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2B1A1">make that hermit crab of a Brachyura (Divine!  Pah!) acknowledge you in front of everyone</a>.  You deserve it!</p>

<p>Or maybe you don&#39;t.  All you really did was stow away on a ship and make one little suggestion, and then Divine Brachyura and Commander Kelpbane took care of the action.  And what does fame matter, anyway?  Your planet is safe now; the crabbers have fled your sector of space.  Isn&#39;t that what&#39;s important?  Maybe you should <a data-dest1="node4A1A1A2B1A2">keep your trap shut and join the party, which is clearly getting underway as you stand around moping.  You see a huge barrel of ale being rolled down the street, and a few crabs have already started singing a victory song.</a></p>
