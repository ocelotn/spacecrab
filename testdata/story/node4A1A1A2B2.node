<p>You let yourself drift into oblivion, hoping that when you wake up everything will be taken care of: the deathstarfish will have eaten Verru, the crabbers will be gone, and Divine Brachyura will have had someone drag you home to bed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, what happens instead is that Divine Brachyura realizes the deathstarfish will most likely destroy your ship before turning its attention to Verru (your ship being the thing that nettled it in the first place, after all).  She sets the ship to eject her into space, forgetting all about you until she&#39;s already clear of the vessel.  She shrugs and scuttles away toward the nearest crabship.</p>

<p>On the bright side, you don&#39;t feel a thing when the deathstarfish blows you to tiny bits and skims the floating pieces into its maw.</p>

<p>THE END.</p>
