<p>You burst from your hiding place, startling Divine Brachyura long enough to grab the mic out of her sturdy claw.  Clearing your throat, you burst into a full-throated rendition of the Brachyuran National Anthem:</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Hail to thee, Brachya, pearl within the shellâ€”</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Before you make it all the way through the first line, Divine Brachyura recovers her wits and slams you over the head with one doughty claw.  You die with a proud smile on your face; muttering, Divine Brachyura shoves your carcass off the control panel and goes back to directing the battle.</p>

<p>THE END.</p>
