<p>You go on gawking like an idiot for some time, unable to tear your eyes away from what the crabbers are doing inside that horrifying room. </p> 

<p>Well, that was bad idea.  One of the crabbers wandering about outside spots you, sneaks up behind you, and cracks you over the head.  You flap onto your back in the sand, dazed.  He doesn&#39;t kill you immediately, of course; you&#39;ll taste much fresher if you go into the pot alive.</p>

<p>THE END.</p>
