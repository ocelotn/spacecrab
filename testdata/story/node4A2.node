<p>You&#39;re going to have to present Divine Brachyura with evidence that something fishy is going on with Verru, and the only way to do that is to go record some images with your handy wrist device.  You won&#39;t actually have wrists when you use it, because you&#39;ll be in crabform. You spend a moment pondering this irony, then take yourself firmly in claw.  You&#39;re stalling!  There&#39;s no time for nervous dithering.  You tap out the proper commands and the Cockleshell sends you flying out through the airlock.  Crabform kicks in immediately, turning you into an independent space-worthy unit, small but hardy.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take you long to reach Verru; the Cockleshell lobbed you out of the airlock with force, sending you sailing toward the small moon. As you near the surface, you employ claws and legs to steer yourself to a landing a few yards away from what you&#39;ve identified as a landing strip.  You want to be close enough that reaching the crabber base won&#39;t take an hour, but far enough away that you don&#39;t land in the middle of a crabber audience.  You gauge your descent to perfection, of course, and land among scrubby bushes and trees just outside the crabber compound.</p>

<p>You scuttle closer, ducking behind Verru&#39;s scrubby shrubberies as best you can.  Surprisingly, there aren&#39;t very many crabbers puttering around, though you peer carefully at every nook and cranny you think could contain a stealthy crabber.  You see a few crabbers off in the distance, but that&#39;s all. Odd!</p>

<p>Perhaps they&#39;re inside that long building, the one stretching off into the distance.  It does appear to be the centerpiece of the crabber encampment, and, conveniently, its walls are lined with windows.  You take a deep breath, steel yourself, and <a data-dest1="node4A1A1">scuttle up to the nearest one, poking your head up to peer inside</a>.
