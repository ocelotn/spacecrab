<p>There&#39;s no way the Cockleshell 2600 can handle a fight against three enemy ships.  You desperately shift gears and send the Cockleshell flying homeward.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there&#39;s also no way the Cockleshell 2600 can outrun three enemy ships, either.  It wasn&#39;t build for fighting, it wasn&#39;t built for speed...as the enemy ships&#39; lasers destroy you, you wonder what the hell it <i>was</i> built for, anyway.</p>

<p>THE END.</p>
